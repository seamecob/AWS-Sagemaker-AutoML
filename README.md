Machine Learning Lab: Bank Note Authentication using Amazon SageMaker

This repository contains the code and instructions for a machine learning lab focused on building a bank note authentication model using Amazon SageMaker. In this lab, you will follow a step-by-step process to choose a machine learning problem, prepare the dataset, set up Amazon S3 and Amazon SageMaker, develop and train the model, and finally deploy and test the model using SageMaker's deployment capabilities.

Problem Selection
Start by choosing a machine learning problem that you want to tackle during this lab. Consider factors such as the dataset availability, problem type (classification, regression, etc.), and your familiarity with the problem domain.

Dataset
Identify or acquire a suitable dataset for your machine learning problem. You can use Kaggle datasets to obtain your data. Here's the link to the dataset we'll be using: [Bank Note Authentication Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritesaluja/bank-note-authentication-uci-data)

Ensure the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and preprocess it if necessary.

Amazon S3 Setup
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store your dataset and any other related files. Familiarise yourself with S3 bucket permissions and configure them according to your requirements.

Amazon SageMaker Setup
1. Create a SageMaker notebook instance or use an existing one.
2. Connect the notebook instance to your Amazon S3 bucket to access the dataset.
